Lab 2B: CloudFront + API caching correctness
Project Summary
You will configure CloudFront behaviors so that:
    Static content is cached aggressively (fast + cheap)
    API responses are cached only when safe, or not cached at all
    The cache key includes the minimum needed values (to avoid cache fragmentation), 
      but includes all required values (to avoid serving the wrong response)
    You can prove correctness using response headers like Age and CloudFront cache indicators, plus application-level evidence

Why it matters to the workforce
This lab is a direct mirror of production:
  Most outages around CDNs aren’t “CloudFront is down.”
  They are misconfigured caching:
    auth/session mixups (catastrophic)
    stale reads after writes
    “works in dev, breaks in prod” because headers/cookies/query strings weren’t forwarded

Modern orgs expect engineers to understand:
    cache key composition 
    how cache + origin request policies interact 
    cache-control semantics (prefer Cache-Control over Expires)
